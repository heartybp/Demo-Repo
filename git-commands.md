Git is a powerful version control system commonly used for managing source code in software development projects. Here are some basic Git commands:

1. `git init`: Initializes a new Git repository in the current directory.

2. `git clone <repository_url>`: Creates a local copy of a remote repository.

3. `git add <file>`: Adds a file to the staging area, preparing it for a commit.

4. `git commit -m "commit message"`: Commits the changes in the staging area, creating a new commit with a descriptive message.

5. `git status`: Displays the current status of the repository, including modified files and files ready for commit.

6. `git pull`: Fetches and merges changes from a remote repository into the current branch.

7. `git push`: Pushes local commits to a remote repository.

8. `git branch`: Lists all branches in the repository.

9. `git checkout <branch>`: Switches to a specified branch.

10. `git merge <branch>`: Merges a specified branch into the current branch.

11. `git log`: Shows a history of commits, including commit messages and details.

12. `git diff`: Shows the differences between the working directory and the staging area.

13. `git remote add <name> <repository_url>`: Associates a remote repository with a local repository.

14. `git remote -v`: Lists all remote repositories associated with the current repository.

15. `git fetch`: Retrieves the latest changes from a remote repository without merging them.

Git provides a wide range of functionality, and there are many more commands and options available. You can explore additional commands and their options in the Git documentation or by using `git --help` or `git <command> --help` for specific command details.
